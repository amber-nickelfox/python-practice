    "#### Why python was created ?\n",
    "My original motivation for creating Python was the perceived need for a higher level language in the Amoeba [Operating Systems] project. I realized that the development of system administration utilities in C was taking too long. Moreover, doing these things in the Bourne shell wouldn’t work for a variety of reasons. … So, there was a need for a language that would bridge the gap between C and the shell."
